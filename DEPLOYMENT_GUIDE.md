  ]
}
```

### Updated package.json:

- Added `"vercel-build": "react-scripts build"` script

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Steps

### If you still don't see updates:

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Login with your GitHub account (devr01499-ui)
   - Check if the project "Xmain" is connected
   - Look for any build errors or warnings

2. **Force Redeploy**:
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Click on "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private mode
   - Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

4. **Check URL**:
   - Make sure you're visiting the correct Vercel URL
   - Not a cached localhost version

5. **Verify Changes Locally**:
   - Open `test-changes.html` in your browser
   - This shows all the changes working locally

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify changes are in the code:

```bash
# Check if changes are in built files
node verify-changes.js

# Check git status
git status

# Check latest commits
git log --oneline -5
```

## 📱 Expected Results

When the deployment is working, you should see:

1. **Home Page**:
   - 9 service cards (was 7, now 9)
   - "Ready to Transform Your Business? 🚀" with rocket emoji
   - Animated floating circles in CTA section
   - Partner cards with stock images

2. **All Pages**:
   - Always start from the top when navigating
   - Smooth scroll behavior

3. **Contact Page**:
   - Working contact form with instant response
   - New service options in dropdown

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

1. **Check Vercel Project Settings**:
   - Framework: Create React App
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

2. **Check GitHub Integration**:
   - Repository: devr01499-ui/Xmain
   - Branch: master
   - Auto-deploy: enabled

3. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Download the build folder
   - Upload to Vercel manually
   - Or use Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`

## 📞 Support

If you're still having issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify GitHub repository is public
3. Ensure Vercel has access to the repository
4. Try creating a new Vercel project and connecting it to the same repo

The changes are definitely in the code and should be working. The issue is likely with Vercel deployment configuration or browser caching.
